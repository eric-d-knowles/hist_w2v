    "This workflow is resource-intensive and is probably only practical when run on a computing cluster. On my university's High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, I request the maximum 14 cores (48 logical processors) and 128G of memory and use a 2T fast-I/O NVMe SSD filespace—and I still run up against time and resource limits. I've designed the code to be efficient, although further optimization is surely possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code affords options to keep conserve resources. Throughout the workflow you can specify `compress=True`, which tells a script to compress its output files. In my experience, there is little downside to using LZ4 compression, since it's very fast and cuts file sizes by about half. Downstream modules will see the `.lz4` extensions and handle the files accordingly. If you know your workflow runs correctly and wish to further conserve space, you can specify `delete_input=True` for many of the scripts; this will delete the source files for a given step once it is complete. The scripts are fairly memory-efficient—with the exception of `sort_ngrams` and `index_and_create_vocab_files`, which sort multiple files in memory at once. When processing multigrams, I've found that allocating more than ~10 workers in these scripts leads to memory exhaustion (with 128G!) and slow processing.\n",

    "**NOTE:** You'll probably want to have run `workflow_unigrams.ipynb` before processing multigrams. That workflos allows you create a vocabulary file for filtering out uncommon tokens from the multigrams.

    "This module removes tokens that provide little information about words' semantic context—specifically, those that contain numerals (`numerals=True`), nonalphabetic characters (`nonalpha=True`), stopwords (high-frequency, low information tokens like \"the\" and \"into\"; `stops=True`), or short words (those below a certain user-specified character count; here, `min_token_length=3`). You can also specify a **vocabulary file** like the one illustrated in the unigram workflow. A vocabulary file is simply a list of the _N_ most common words in the unigram corpus; the multigram tokens are checked against this list and those that don't appear in it are dropped.\n",

The training of word-embedding models requires _linguistic context_—which in turn requires ngrams containing more than one token. A unigram isn't useful for helping a model learn what \"company\" a word keeps. Thus, the `min_tokens` option allows you to drop ngrams that fall below a specified length during filtering. If filtering results in an ngram with fewer than the minimum tokens, all data for that ngram is dropped entirely. Here, I've set `min_tokens=2`, since two tokens (and higher) provide at least some contextual information.\n",
