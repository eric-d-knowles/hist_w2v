    "This workflow is resource-intensive and is probably only practical when run on a computing cluster. On my university's High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, I request the maximum 14 cores (48 logical processors) and 128G of memory and use a 2T fast-I/O NVMe SSD filespace—and I still run up against time and resource limits. I've designed the code to be efficient, although further optimization is surely possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code affords options to conserve resources. Throughout the workflow you can specify `compress=True`, which tells a script to compress its output files. In my experience, there is little downside to using LZ4 compression, since it's very fast and cuts file sizes by about half. Downstream modules will see the `.lz4` extensions and handle the files accordingly. If you know your workflow runs correctly and wish to further conserve space, you can specify `delete_input=True` for many of the scripts; this will delete the source files for a given step once it is complete. The scripts are fairly memory-efficient—with the exception of `sort_ngrams` and `index_and_create_vocab_files`, which sort multiple files in memory at once. When processing multigrams, I've found that allocating more than ~10 workers in these scripts leads to memory exhaustion (with 128G!) and slow processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** You'll probably want to have run `workflow_unigrams.ipynb` before processing multigrams. That workflos allows you create a vocabulary file for filtering out uncommon tokens from the multigrams.

You can also specify a **vocabulary file** like the one produced in the unigram workflow. A vocabulary file is simply a list of the _N_ most common words in the unigram corpus; the multigram tokens are checked against this list and those that don't appear in it are dropped.\n",

    "The `replace_unk` option controls what happens to ineligible tokens. If `replace_unk=False` (the default), then these tokens are erased from the ngrams. If `replace_unk=True`, then ineligible tokens will be replaced with `UNK` (the \"unknown\" symbol). The filtering process will inevitably reduce the amount of useful information contained in some ngrams. If `replace_unk=False`, some longer ngrams (e.g., 5grams) will become shorter (e.g., 3grams) after unwanted tokens are dropped. And if `replace_unk=True`, filtering will reduce the number of real tokens in certain ngrams by replacing one or more of tokens with `UNK`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training of word-embedding models requires _linguistic context_, which in turn requires ngrams containing more than one token. (A unigram isn't useful for helping a model learn what \"company\" a word keeps.) The `min_tokens` option allows you to drop ngrams that fall below a specified length (or number of real tokens) during filtering. If filtering results in an ngram with fewer than the minimum number of real tokens, all data for that ngram is dropped entirely. I usually set `min_tokens=2`, since two tokens (and higher) provide at least some contextual information."

    "This module converts the overall corpus file into yearly corpora. For each year in which an ngram appeared, a `<year>.jsonl` file (or `<year>.jsonl.lz4` if `compress=True`) will be created. Each line in a yearly file contains an ngram, a `freq` value (the number of times it appeared that year), and a `doc` value (the number of unique documents it appeared in that year).\n",
    "\n",
    "I found it difficult to prevent memory exhaustion when processing 5grams with 128GB of RAM. Users may have to reduce the number of processors and/or the `chunk_size` to stay within their limits. Also note that the final clean-up step, in which many temporary files get deleted, can take several minutes to complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "After creating yearly corpora, we can proceed to train `word2vec` models as shown in the `workflow_train_models.ipynb` notebook."
